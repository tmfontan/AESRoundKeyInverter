# AES-128 Inverse Key Expansion & Forensic Analysis Tool
 
This project is a Java-based cryptographic utility designed to reverse the AES-128 round key generation process. It reconstructs the original 128-bit encryption key along with all previously generated round keys, providing a powerful tool for cryptographic analysis, debugging, and educational purposes.

Key Features:
    <br>- Inverse Key Expansion – Recovers the original AES-128 key and each round key from an existing key schedule.
    <br>- Custom Round Key Data Structure – Implements a dedicated RoundKey object for organized storage and easy access to round numbers and their corresponding byte arrays.
    <br>- Forensic & Educational Use Cases – Ideal for understanding AES key scheduling, performing cryptographic research, or validating encryption implementations.
