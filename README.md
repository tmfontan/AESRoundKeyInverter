<h1 style="text-align: center;">AES-128 Inverse Key Expansion & Forensic Analysis Tool</h1>

![Alt text](https://github.com/tmfontan/AESRoundKeyInverter/blob/main/AES-128.svg)

A Java-based cryptographic utility that reverses the AES-128 round key generation process to reconstruct the original 128-bit encryption key and all previously generated round keys. This project is designed for cryptographic research, forensic analysis, debugging, and educational purposes.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Features</h2>
1. Inverse Key Expansion – Retrieves the original AES-128 key and every round key from an existing key schedule.

2. Custom Round Key Data Structure – Implements a dedicated RoundKey object to store the round number and corresponding byte array for clean organization and easy retrieval.

3. Forensic & Educational Applications – Supports learning, validating encryption processes, and investigating cryptographic key handling in systems.
